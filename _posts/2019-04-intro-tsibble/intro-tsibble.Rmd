```{r initial, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE,
  fig.path = 'figure/', fig.align = 'center', fig.show = 'hold',
  fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "png", dpi = 300,
  cache.path = 'cache/', cache = TRUE, comment = "#>",
  out.width = "100%"

## Introduction

```{r ts-model, fig.cap = "(ref:ts-model-cap)"}
include_graphics("img/ts-model.png")
```

(ref:ts-model-cap) Illustration of the current time series analysis workflow, adapted from *R for Data Science*. The missing "tidy" temporal data structure leads to a myriad of ad hoc solutions and duplicated efforts from raw data to model-oriented time series. 

## Tidy data representation for temporal data

## Domain specific language for wrangling temporal data

## Rolling windows with functional programming
